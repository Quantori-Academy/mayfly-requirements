# 4.1.1. Create Order from Reagent requests
As a procurement officer, I want to be able to create a new order for reagents using existing reagent requests.

1. When User is on the page with a form for creating/editing an order
   * It is possible to see a list of reagent requests
   * It is possible to select a reagent request and add it to the order
2. Adding a reagent request to the order
   * Creates a new row in the reagents table in the order and prefill it with fields dorm reagent request
   * Creates a link between reagent request and the order - changes if ther order status should update statuses of all linked request.
