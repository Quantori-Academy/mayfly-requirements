# 3.2. Create reagent request
As a researcher, I want to be able to create a reagent request

1. The form should be available via "Create a reagent request" button on Reagent Requests Page
2. Form Layout:
   * Reagent Name (input type="text", mandatory)
   * Structure - SMILES format (input type="text", optional)
   * Structure - Rendered Structure from Smiles, image, readonly
   * CAS Number (input type="text", optional) (in future Chemical structure could be searched in database based onCAS)
   * Desired Quantity (input type="text", mandatory)
   * User Comments (input type="textarea", optional))
   * Procurement Comments (input type="textarea", readonly)
   * Status - readonly
3. Form Submission:
   When the researcher submits the form, the system should create a new reagent request object in the database, with the following properties:
   * id: a unique identifier (e.g., UUID)
   * userId: the ID of the researcher who created the request
   * creationDate: the date and time the request was created
   * procurementComments: empty
   * status: pending
4. Accessibility:
   The system should be accessible on a variety of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones, to ensure that researchers can create reagent requests regardless of their location or device type.
