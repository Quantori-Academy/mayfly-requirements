# 2.2. Delete storage
As an administrator, I want to be remove storage locations

Storage Location Management Page

* Administrators (and only administrator) should be able to select the storage location they want to delete from the list and confirm the deletion.
* If storage location has reagents it can't be deleted - the system should show a warning message
* If storage location is empty the user should see Delete confirmation dialog with buttons "Delete" and "Cancel"
* When an administrator deletes a storage location, the system should display a notification message to ensure that the deletion was successful
* If there are any errors when deleting a storage location, the system should display an error message and provide feedback on what went wrong.
