# 4.2. Orders List
As a procurement officer, I want to be able to view existing orders

1. Order Management Page:
   * The page should display a list of all existing orders made by users in the system.
   * The list should include columns for:
     * order title
     * creation date
     * modification date
     * seller
     * status (pending, ordered, completed).
   * The list should be sortable and filterable by columns.
   * The list should have pagination
2. Order Detail Page:
   * When a user clicks on an order in the list, they should be taken to a detailed page that displays information about the order.
