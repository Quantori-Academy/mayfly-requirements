# 5.2. Add, edit sample
1. As user I want toadd and edit reagents in the system.

* Reagent List Page should have a "Create sample" button

1. Sample Detail Page:
   * When a user clicks on a reagent in the list, they should be taken to a detailed page that displays information about the reagent.
   * The page should show all sample fields
2. Add Sample Form:
   * A form that allows users to add a new reagent to the system.
   * The form should include fields for:
     * Name
     * Structure (Chemical structure editor)
     * Description
     * Quantity unit (e.g., ml)
     * size (500 ml)
     * Quantity Left
     * List of reagents/samples used for preparation of this sample
     * expirationDate
     * Storage location: Room, Cabinet, Shelf
   * When the form is submitted, a new sample should be created in the system with the entered information.
3. Edit Sample Form:
   * It should be possible to change Quantity Left field value
   * If Quantity Left == 0 the reagent is removed from the system
   * It should be possible to change sample storage location
