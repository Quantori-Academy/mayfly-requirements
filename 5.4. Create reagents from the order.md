# 5.4. Create reagents from the order
As a procurement officer, I want to be able to mark an order as completed when the reagents have been received and stored

1. When the procurement officer selects an order from the Order List Page, they should be taken to a dedicated page for that order with detailed information about the order
2. Mark Order as Complete: When the procurement officer clicks on the "Mark Order as Complete" button, the system should display a form allowing them to enter the new storage location for all reagents in the order.
3. Confirmation Messages: To ensure that the procurement officer is aware of any changes made to the order, the system should display confirmation messages when the order is marked as complete or when the reagents are updated in storage. These messages should include a summary of the changes made and the new status of the order.
