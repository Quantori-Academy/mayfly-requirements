# 4. Order Management
[[4.1. Create Order]]
[[4.2. Orders List]]
[[4.3. Change order status]]

An order created by a procurement officer in the system is a request to purchase one or more chemical reagents.

#### The workflow of creating an order involves the following steps:

1. The procurement officer navigates to the Orders Management Page and clicks on the "Create new order" button.
2. The procurement officer fills out a form with necessary information such as the reagent name, quantity desired, CAS number (if available), and any comments.
3. The user submits the form, which creates a new order object in the database.
4. The procurement officer consolidates the orders and creates orders to purchase the chemicals from suppliers.
5. When the supplier delivers the ordered reagents, the procurement officer updates the order status to "completed" and transfer chemicals to the storage locations.

#### The order status can be one of the following:

1. Pending: The order has been created but not yet submitted for fulfillment.
2. Submitted: The user has submitted the order to the supplier.
3. Fulfilled: The supplier has delivered the ordered reagents.
4. Canceled: The user has canceled the order before it was fulfilled.

#### The Order object in the database will have the following properties:

* id: a unique identifier (e.g., UUID)
* userId: the ID of the who created the request
* creationDate: the date and time the request was created
* status
* list of reagents in the order

#### The Reagent object in the database will have the following properties:

* id: a unique identifier (e.g., UUID)
* name: e.g. Hexan, Laboratory Reagent, â‰¥95%
* structure?: e.g. CCCCCC, SMILES format
* cas?: e.g. 110-54-3
* producer: e.g. Sigma-Aldrich
* catalogId?: e.g. 208752
* catalogLink?: e.g. <https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/AT/de/product/sigald/208752>
* units: e.g. bottle 500 ml
* pricePerUnit: e.g. 45.15$
* quantity: e.g. 6, means we buy 6 bottles 500 ml each
