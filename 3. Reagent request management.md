A reagent request is a request made by a chemist or researcher to purchase a specific chemical reagent for use in their laboratory experiments. The system allows users to create reagent requests, view their list of reagent requests, and track the status of each request throughout its lifecycle.

The workflow of a reagent request involves several stages:

* Creation: A chemist or researcher creates a new reagent request by filling out a form with the necessary information, such as the reagent name, quantity desired, CAS number (if available), and any comments.
* Submission: The user submits the form, which creates a new reagent request object in the database.
* Procurement: The procurement officer consolidates the requests and creates orders to purchase the chemicals from suppliers.
* Fulfillment: Upon receiving the ordered chemicals, the procurement officer allocates them to their designated storage locations.

The statuses of a reagent request include:

* Pending: The request has been created but not yet procured or fulfilled.
* Ordered: The request has been marked as ordered, indicating that the supplier has received the order and is processing it.
* Fulfilled: The request has been marked as fulfilled, indicating that the chemicals have been delivered to the laboratory and are ready for use.
* Declined: The request has been declined by the procurement officer, usually due to unavailability or other reasons.
