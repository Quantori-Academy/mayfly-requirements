# 5.1. Reagents list
As user, I want to be able to see reagents and samples list

1. Reagent List Page:
   * A dedicated page for displaying all reagents and samples in the system
   * The list should include columns for:
     * Name
     * Category (reagent or sample)
     * Structure (rendered chemical structure)
     * Description
     * Quantity left
     * Storage Location
     * Action buttons (edit)
2. Filtering and Sorting:
   * The list of reagents and samples should be sortable and filterable by columns (name, category, status).
3. It should be possible to search reagents by chemical structure / substructure
