# 5.3. Add, edit reagent
As a user I want to add and edit reagents in the system.

* Reagent List Page should have a "Create reagent" button
* Typically, reagents are created when the order is fulfilled, but it should be possible to create reagents without initial order.

1. Reagent Detail Page:
   * When a user clicks on a reagent in the list, they should be taken to a detailed page that displays information about the reagent.
   * The page should include fields for:
     * Reagent ID
     * Name
     * Category
     * Description
     * Structure (rendered image)
     * CAS number
     * Producer (Supplier)
     * Catalog ID
     * Catalog link
     * Units (e.g., bottle 500 ml)
     * Price per unit ($)
     * Quantity (number)
     * Action buttons (edit, delete)
2. Add Reagent Form:
   * A form that allows users to add a new reagent to the system.
   * The form should include fields for:
     * Name
     * Structure (Chemical structure editor)
     * CAS number
     * Producer (Supplier)
     * Catalog ID
     * Catalog link
     * Price per unit ($)
     * Quantity unit (e.g., ml)
     * Quantity (initial quantity, e.g., 500 ml)
     * ^^^ the fields above are from an order entity
     * Quantity Left
     * expirationDate
     * Storage location: Room, Cabinet, Shelf
   * When the form is submitted, a new reagent should be created in the system with the entered information.
3. Edit Reagent Form:
   * It should be possible to change Quantity Left field value
   * If Quantity Left == 0 the reagent is removed from the system
   * It should be possible to change reagent storage location
