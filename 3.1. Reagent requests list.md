# 3.1. Reagent requests list
As a researcher, I want to be able to see my reagent requests list

1. Reagent Requests Page:
   * The page should display a list of all reagent requests made by the user, including the reagent name, desired quantity, status, and any comments.
   * The list should have pagination
   * The list should be sortable and filterable by columns.
2. Reagent Request Detail Page:
   * When a user clicks on a reagent request in the list, they should be taken to a detailed page that displays the request information
3. Filtering and Sorting:
   * The list of reagent requests should have filters and sort options for easy navigation and management. For example, users could filter by status (e.g., pending, ordered, declined) or sort by date created or quantity requested.
4. Columns:
   * The table displaying the reagent requests should have columns for the following information:
     * Reagent name
     * Structure - chemical structure rendering from SMILES
     * CAS, e.g. 123-15-2256
     * Desired quantity, e.g. 500 ml
     * Status - pending, ordered, declined, completed
     * User comments
     * Procurement comments
     * Date created
     * Date modified
5. User Roles:
   * Only users who have made reagent requests should be able to view their list of requests.
   * Procurement officer should be able to view and manage all reagent requests made by users in the system.
